Introduction to node - 

Node is a way to run javascript outside of a browser
You don't need an HTML in order to see the output 
That way you can write code and check the console.log for all confirmation instead of having to connect to the html file (browser).

This will connect with the server side of the full-stack program 
Node allows you (via modules) to communicate your javascript to the server

npm (node packagage manager)

npm install jquery will add jquery to you program
